### Hello there, it seems you've stumbled upon my Github page

I'm a web software developer based in Helsinki, Finland. 
My main focus has been on React/Vue frontend work, with a foundation in MERN full-stack development.
Recently I've taken an interest in learning Go and GLSL as hobby-projects that progress at a slow but steady pace.

I am about 80% through with my BA in Digital Design from Metropolia UAS, which you can learn more about <a href="https://digimuotoilu.metropolia.fi/study" target="_blank">here</a> (in Finnish)

I am currently employed at [Futurice](https://futurice.com) in Helsinki, but I am always open to have a chat about new opportunities.

Besides programming I enjoy making music and reading books or listening to podcasts.
